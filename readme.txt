With the Topcontent plugin, you can have content orders automatically published directly to your website.

== Description ==

At Topcontent we work hard to create the text you need for your websites. With the Topcontent plugin, you can have finished content automatically published on your website.

In other words, with this plugin, you no longer need to manually publish your content. Instead, you assign which site the content should be published on when placing a content order. And when the content is ready, it will automatically be published on that site. You can also set which date the article should be published.

This is an extremely useful plugin if you manage several WordPress sites and need to create long term content plans. For example, if you want to publish one article a week over a year, you can place an order for 52 articles and specify different publishing dates. The content will automatically be published on your site on those dates.
